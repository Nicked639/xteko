# Emoji Mosaic

Emoji Mosaic is an interesting project, it converts image to emoji based mosaic, the original version could be found here: https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/emoji-mosaic

This is an offline version based on JSBox, I made it with greatest appreciate to [Eric Lewis](https://github.com/ericandrewlewis) who built the original version!
